# SimpBot

Well, uhhh... Essentially what this does is for all those simps out there, I hardwired a Staples easy button to an arduino and wrote this script so it asks for your twitch login info and every time you press the button, it opens a new browser, donates 2 dollars to Pokimane, and automatically logs you in. it also has a nice little motivational photo that opens every time you complete a transaction to remind you who and what you really are.

I'll probably make a video explaining it at some point, but for now, if you know, you know.
